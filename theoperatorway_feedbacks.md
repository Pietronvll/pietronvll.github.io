## Feedbacks:
- Visuals about linearization of dynamical systems & dynamical systems in general
- Perhaps it would be nice to expand [the history section] and tell why it took so long for the operator way to be taken seriously and what are its main advantages/drawbacks when compared to classical methods.
- Too much dwelling on linear transformation possibly not needed
- giving an example of linearizing a nonlinear dynamical system could help a lot to digest what is this Koopman operator
